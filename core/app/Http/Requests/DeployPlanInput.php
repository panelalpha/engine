 * shape, and rejects it in the same words — a caller who learned it from one
 * endpoint has learned it everywhere. It is deliberately not a validation rule
 * on each FormRequest: what makes a command legal is the manifest grammar
 * ({@see \App\Lib\Deploy\Platform\PlatformCommand::fromArray}), and restating
 * that grammar in Laravel rules would give two definitions of the same thing,
 * to disagree with each other later.
 *
 * The plan is not stored anywhere. It belongs to the request that sent it, so
 * it goes into the request-scoped {@see DeployPlanContext} and is gone with
 * the response — deploy again without it and the platform's defaults are back.
