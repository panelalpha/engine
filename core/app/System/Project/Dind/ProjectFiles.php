 * Reading a file out of the account's project directory.

 * Always through the System API rather than PHP's own filesystem functions:
 * ~/project is inside the account container and root-owned on the host, so a
 * plain file_get_contents() would answer for the wrong tree — or for nothing
 * at all. {@see \App\Lib\Deploy\Platform\Probes\ProcfileWebProbe} reads host
 * paths directly and is right to; anything asking what the *account* has must
 * come through here.
 *
 * Absent and empty are one answer on purpose. Every caller is asking "is
 * there a composer.json to read", and a zero-byte one is not something to
 * hand a JSON parser.
