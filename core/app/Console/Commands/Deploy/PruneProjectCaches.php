/**
 * Delete the host caches of projects that have not deployed recently.
 *
 * These caches exist only to make the *next* deploy fast -- `git clone` wipes
 * ~/project on every deploy, so vendor/ and node_modules are rebuilt every
 * time, and the caches are what keep that off packagist and the npm registry.
 * Nothing mounts them into a running application: once a deploy finishes they
 * are read by nobody until the next one.
 *
 * Which makes the arithmetic bad for the common hosting case. A site deployed
 * once and then served for months holds its caches -- ~306MB for a Laravel
 * skeleton with a Vite front end -- for exactly as long as it never reads
 * them, and until this existed nothing ever reclaimed them: disk-pressure
 * reclaim works on the account's inner Docker, and account teardown only fires
 * when the account is deleted.
 *
 * The whole directory goes, not just the download caches. Keeping node_modules
 * would leave ~65MB per project accumulating forever, which is the problem
 * rather than a smaller version of it. The cost is that a project redeploying
 * after the window pays a full install -- which it would have paid anyway,
 * since reusing node_modules needs a byte-identical lockfile and a project
 * that has not deployed in a long time is unlikely to have one.
 *
 * The work itself is {@see ProjectCache::PRUNE_SCRIPT}; this decides the
 * window, protects deploys in flight, and reports.
