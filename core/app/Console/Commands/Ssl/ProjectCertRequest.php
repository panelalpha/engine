/**
 * Obtain a real certificate for one project domain, on demand.
 *
 * The deploy asks for a certificate once, when the domain is created — which
 * is usually before its DNS points at this host, so the first answer is the
 * self-signed one. This is the second answer: run it when the name resolves
 * here and the site starts serving a certificate browsers accept, with no
 * redeploy and no downtime.
 *
 * `--dry-run` reports what would be attempted and why, without spending an
 * authorization against a rate limit that counts failures.
 *
 * The same thing over the API is `POST /projects/{u}/domains/{d}/request-ssl-cert`;
 * both go through {@see ProjectCertificate}.
