/**
 * The domain new projects are given a name under.
 *
 * A project created without a domain of its own becomes
 * `<name>.<this setting>` ({@see \App\Lib\Helper::generateDomainName()}). It
 * has always defaulted to `<dashed-ip>.sslip.io`, which resolves to this host
 * with no DNS to set up — the reason a fresh install works at all, and the
 * reason those sites can never hold a real certificate: sslip.io is one
 * registered domain shared by everyone, and Let's Encrypt's limit is counted
 * per registered domain. {@see SharedZones}
 *
 * So this is the one setting that turns real certificates on. Point a wildcard
 * A record for a domain you control at this host, set it here, and every
 * project created afterwards gets a name under it that an authority will
 * certify.
 *
 * Existing projects keep the domain they were created with — renaming a live
 * site's domain is a different operation with different consequences, and it
 * is not this one.
