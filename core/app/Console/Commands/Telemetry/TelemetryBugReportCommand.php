/**
 * File a bug about a deployed app, from the box it is running on.
 *
 * The console half of `POST /bug-reports`, and the surface that matters most:
 * the person who notices an app is wrong is usually the one SSHed into the
 * machine at the time, and asking them to go and find an API token first is how
 * a report turns into no report.
 *
 * The project is required, and everything expensive about the report is
 * gathered from it here: what the engine detects the application to be, a live
 * probe of every port it publishes, its last deploy, and the tail of that
 * deploy's log. What is left for a human is the two things only they know —
 * what went wrong, and what should have happened instead.
 *
 * `--dry-run` prints the report and sends nothing, for the same reason
 * `telemetry:show` exists: nobody should have to take the engine's word for
 * what it is about to say about their customers.
