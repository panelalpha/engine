/**
 * What a certificate actually is, in the words something can act on.
 *
 * The parsed certificate already carried the facts — issuer, validity window,
 * the names it covers — but every one of them had to be interpreted before it
 * meant anything: a caller had to compare the issuer's common name to the
 * subject's to learn that a certificate was self-signed, and turn a
 * `not_after` unix timestamp into "expires when". A caller that only wants to
 * say whether the site has a real certificate should not have to do
 * certificate arithmetic to find out, and one that guesses will report
 * "issued SSL" for the self-signed certificate the engine generates for every
 * project domain.
 *
 * `status` is the single word for that: the worst true thing about the
 * certificate, so a caller that reads nothing else is not misled. The
 * booleans and dates stay beside it for a caller that wants to be precise.
 *
 * No Laravel dependencies — unit-testable.
