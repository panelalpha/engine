 * Where a domain's certificate comes from.

 * served with a certificate no browser accepts and nothing in the API said
 * so. Making it an interface is the point of the exercise: an operator who
 * wants Let's Encrypt sets one setting, an operator with an internal CA
 * writes one class, and the engine's own decision about *when* to issue does
 * not move.
 *
 * An implementation installs what it issued (`Domain::putCertificate()`) and
 * throws when it cannot. It never falls back — choosing what to do about a
 * failure belongs to {@see Issuers}, which has the self-signed certificate to
 * fall back to and the deploy that must not fail either way.
