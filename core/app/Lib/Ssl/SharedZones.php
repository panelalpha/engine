/**
 * The wildcard DNS zones every engine shares, and why a project domain under
 * one of them does not get its own Let's Encrypt certificate.
 *
 * `sslip.io`, `nip.io` and `panelalpha.direct` resolve `<dashed-ip>.<zone>`
 * back to the address in the name, which is what makes a project reachable on
 * a fresh install with no DNS to set up. It also means every engine in the
 * fleet issues under the *same registered domain*, and Let's Encrypt counts
 * new certificates per registered domain: 50 per 7 days, refilling at one per
 * ~202 minutes. None of these zones is on the Public Suffix List and none can
 * be — the PSL guidelines reject wildcard IP-to-name zones explicitly — so
 * there is no boundary for the limit to land on.
 *
 * Fifty projects a week, fleet-wide, is not a per-project certificate
 * mechanism; it is a way to exhaust the limit for everyone including the
 * engines that need it for their own admin certificate. An operator who wants
 * real certificates for the sites points a domain they control at the host and
 * sets it as the base domain. Until then a project domain keeps the
 * certificate the engine signs itself, which costs nothing and breaks nobody.
 *
 * A custom domain a customer owns is never affected by this: it is their
 * registered domain, with their own limit.
 *
 * No Laravel dependencies — unit-testable.
