/**
 * Which issuer a domain gets, and what happens when it cannot deliver.
 *
 * Three settings, and the defaults keep a stock engine behaving exactly as it
 * did before this existed:
 *
 *   ssl_issuer          self_signed (default) | acme
 *   acme_directory_url  the ACME v2 directory; `staging` is a shorthand for
 *                       Let's Encrypt's staging CA, and any other RFC 8555
 *                       authority is just its URL
 *   acme_email          ACME account contact; falls back to `cert_email`,
 *                       then the engine's `email`
 *
 * **A certificate is issued once per domain, not once per deploy.**
 * {@see Domain::rebuild()} asks for one only when the domain has none, so a
 * failed attempt leaves a self-signed certificate behind and the next deploy
 * does not stall on the authority again. Getting the real one after the DNS
 * finally points here is `ssl:project-cert:request`, and keeping it is
 * `ssl:project-cert:renew`.
 *
 * The fallback is not optional and not configurable. A site with no
 * certificate does not answer on :443 at all, so "could not obtain a real
 * one" must never mean "serve nothing" — it means serve the self-signed one
 * and say so, which is what `details.ssl` then reports.
