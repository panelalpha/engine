/**
 * Running the engine's own certificate request, for the command and the API.
 *
 * The work is `scripts/letsencrypt-request-cert.sh` in the host namespace:
 * certbot needs the host's `:80`, and the compose stack has to be stopped and
 * started around it, neither of which can be done from inside this container.
 *
 * **This takes every hosted site offline for the length of the challenge.**
 * `sites-http` holds `:80` and certbot's standalone listener wants it, so the
 * service is stopped and brought back — usually seconds, but seconds during
 * which nothing on the box answers. That is tolerable for a deliberate,
 * occasional act and is the reason this is not the mechanism project
 * certificates use ({@see AcmeIssuer} serves its challenge through the
 * running webserver instead).
 *
 * It is also why the API method that calls this is worth reading twice before
 * calling.
