/**
 * A real certificate for a project domain, from Let's Encrypt or any other
 * RFC 8555 authority, over HTTP-01.
 *
 * Almost all of this was already here. Every vhost template — apache, nginx,
 * litespeed, openlitespeed — already serves `/.well-known/acme-challenge/`
 * out of {@see HttpAcmeChallengeStore}, and {@see Domain::putCertificate()}
 * already installs a certificate where the proxy reads it. What was missing
 * was the half that talks to the authority, which is why the panel had to do
 * it from outside and a plain engine had no way to obtain one at all.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* the mechanism the engine's own admin certificate uses.
 * That one runs `certbot --standalone` and takes `sites-http` down to free
 * :80 — acceptable once, for one name; catastrophic per project, where it
 * would drop every hosted site on the box each time a certificate is issued
 * or renewed. Here the challenge is served by the running webserver, so
 * nothing goes offline and issuing for a hundred domains is a loop.
 *
 * The one subtlety is ordering. `http_acme_challenges_enabled` is baked into
 * the vhost when it is rendered, so writing the token is not enough: the
 * vhost has to be re-rendered and the webserver reloaded *before* the
 * authority is told to validate, and again after the token is removed. The
 * store reports the transition (`became_enabled` / `became_disabled`) so the
 * reload happens once per issuance rather than once per token.
