/**
 * Does anything actually trust this certificate?
 *
 * `status: trusted` used to mean "not self-signed", which is a different
 * question and sometimes the opposite answer. A certificate from Let's
 * Encrypt's *staging* authority is signed by a CA, in date, and for the right
 * name -- and every client on earth refuses it. The engine reported it as
 * `trusted (issuer: Let's Encrypt)` while curl was answering
 * `SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate`. Anyone
 * testing an issuance path against staging, which is the responsible way to
 * test one, was told it had worked.
 *
 * So the question is asked of the host's own root store rather than inferred
 * from a name. Null where it cannot be asked -- no CA bundle on the box, an
 * openssl build without the call -- because "we could not check" and "we
 * checked and it fails" must not collapse into one answer.
 *
 * No Laravel dependencies — unit-testable.
