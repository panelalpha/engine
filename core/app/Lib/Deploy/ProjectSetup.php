     * Whether the platform has already resolved this project's dependencies,
     * in which case the project's own `setup` script must not run.
     *
     * A `setup` script is a *workstation* script. laravel/laravel's runs
     * `composer install` and `npm install --ignore-scripts`: exactly what a
     * developer who just cloned the repository needs, and exactly what the
     * deploy has already done. Running it again in the runtime container is
     * wrong twice over.
     *
     * It resolves dependencies in the wrong place. The build belongs on the
     * host -- a throwaway container with the account's warm package cache,
     * {@see \App\\System\\Project\Dind\HostCompile} -- not in the
     * container that is meant to be serving by then.
     *
     * And it resolves them *differently*. A bare `composer install` includes
     * require-dev, so phpunit, mockery, faker and pint land in a production
     * account that the host build had just excluded with `--no-dev`; measured
     * on a Laravel skeleton that was 33 extra packages and 10.3s of the 14s
     * between `compose up` and the first answered request. The npm half then
     * fails outright with `npm: not found`, because the shared PHP base ships
     * no Node -- by design, which is why the PHP manifests declare no npm
     * commands either.
     *
     * Two ways a platform says it has already done this. A PHP runtime always
     * has: `runPhpBuild()` runs for every PHP deploy, from the manifest's own
     * commands or from {@see Platform\Runtime\Php\PhpHostBuild::DEFAULT_INSTALL}
     * when it declares none -- which is most of the shipped PHP manifests.
     * Every other runtime says it by declaring build-stage commands.
     *
     * What is left is a platform with no build stage at all, and there the
     * project's own script is the only bootstrap there is, so it still runs.
