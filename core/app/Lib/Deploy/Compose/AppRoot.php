 * The manifest's `app_root`: the subtree that becomes /app.

 * This lives in one place because two callers have to agree about it and the
 * cost of them disagreeing is silent. {@see FrameworkService} mounts the
 * subtree at /app, and {@see \App\\System\\Project\Dind\Strategy\EntrypointWriter}
 * writes the generated stage script that the base image looks for at
 * /app/panelalpha-entrypoint.sh. While the writer used the checkout root and
 * the mount used the subtree, the script was written somewhere the container
 * could not see: the shim fell through to `serving directly`, and every
 * install, upgrade and start command the manifest declared was dropped
 * without a word in the deploy log. WordPress answered 500 because its
 * wp-config step never ran; phpBB lost the writable-dirs step the same way.
 *
 * Validated rather than trusted: `_schema.json` already rejects an absolute
 * path, but this value ends up as a bind-mount source and as a path written
 * to, so anything that could climb out of the checkout is refused here too.
 * A value that does not survive validation falls back to the checkout root,
 * which is the same answer both callers gave before this existed.
