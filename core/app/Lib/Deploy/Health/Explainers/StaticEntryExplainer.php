/**
 * Why a static site's `/` did not answer with a page.
 *
 * Three shapes, and they need different sentences. The site may have an entry
 * document that is simply gone -- the common one, and the only one where
 * naming the other pages that *are* still there tells the owner what
 * happened. It may have pages but nothing that could be an entry, which is a
 * missing index rather than a missing file. Or it may have no documents at
 * all, which is an upload that did not arrive.
 *
 * Reuses the finders detection itself uses {@see StaticEntry}, {@see HtmlSite},
 * so the entry this names is the entry the next deploy would pick -- an
 * explanation that disagreed with the deploy it describes would send someone
 * looking for the wrong file.
