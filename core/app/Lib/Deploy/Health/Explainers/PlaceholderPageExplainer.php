/**
 * Why the engine's own page is being served instead of an application.
 *
 * Two very different situations produce the same page. An account that has
 * never had an application deployed into it is *supposed* to show the welcome
 * page -- that is what it is for, and reporting it as a fault would make every
 * empty account look broken. An account whose ~/project holds files and still
 * shows a placeholder is the real failure: something was uploaded, nothing
 * claimed it, and the fallback recipe wrote over the top.
 *
 * The two are told apart by whether the directory holds anything but the
 * engine's own handwriting, which is the question
 * {@see \App\Lib\Deploy\Detect\PlaceholderPage::supersededIndex()} already
 * answers for the deploy pipeline.
