/**
 * What the checkout on disk says about the repository it came from.
 *
 * Until this existed a report could only repeat what the *account record*
 * remembered: the `git_repo` a project was created with, and the commit the
 * deploy pipeline happened to freeze next to it. That covers exactly one
 * case -- a project created from a git URL by this engine -- and says nothing
 * about the two that break most often: an archive upload that turns out to
 * carry a `.git`, and a site connected to a remote after the fact through
 * `POST /git/connect`. Both deploy from a repository and both reported
 * `{"present": false}`, so every failure they caused was filed under "no
 * repository" and became uncountable.
 *
 * So this reads the tree instead of the record. The facts are the ones that
 * change what a build does -- where it came from, what is checked out,
 * whether the clone is shallow, whether there are submodules or LFS pointers
 * to resolve -- and nothing else: no file names, no author, no message, no
 * diff. {@see DeployReport::repo()} decides which of them may be transmitted
 * at which tier, the same split {@see AppFacts} makes for package metadata.
 *
 * Every read is best-effort. This runs at the end of a deploy that may have
 * failed halfway through a clone, against a directory that is about to be
 * rolled back; a fact that cannot be read is absent, never an exception.
 *
 * No Laravel dependencies -- unit-testable with any runner.
