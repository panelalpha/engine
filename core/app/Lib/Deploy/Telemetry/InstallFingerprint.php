/**
 * A stable, non-reversible identity for one engine installation.
 *
 * There is no account to log in to and no key to carry: the id is derived from
 * facts about the machine the engine runs on — the Docker daemon's own id, the
 * CPU, the amount of RAM, the host name and the public IP. None of those facts
 * ever leave the box; only the hash does, and a hash of a handful of host facts
 * cannot be turned back into them.
 *
 * Once derived, the id is *pinned* to a file under /opt/panelalpha, and the
 * pinned value always wins. That matters more than it looks: a machine that
 * gets a new IP, more RAM or a rebuilt Docker daemon is still the same
 * installation, and an id that changed underneath it would split that
 * installation's failure history in two and quietly double-count every
 * recurring problem. Derivation is how the id is *born*, not how it is kept.
 *
 * The pin file is deliberately outside the core container's own storage: it
 * sits on the host bind mount, so it survives an image rebuild, an engine
 * update, and `docker compose down -v`.
 *
 * The derivation itself is pure — {@see derive()} is unit-testable.
