/**
 * Names that are about to become part of a filesystem path or a command's

 *
 * Account usernames reach the engine from the database and end up in a log
 * directory, a cache directory, a volume name and half a dozen sudo commands.
 * Each of those sites used to carry its own copy of the same regex, and the
 * copies shared two holes:
 *
 *   - PHP's `$` matches immediately before a final newline, so "acme\n"
 *     passed every one of them;
 *   - `.` and `..` are made only of accepted characters, and both resolve
 *     somewhere other than the account's own directory.
 *
 * The rule lives here once so a fix reaches every caller.
 *
 * No Laravel dependencies — unit-testable with a string.
