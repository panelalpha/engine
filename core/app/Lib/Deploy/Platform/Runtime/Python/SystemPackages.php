 * interpreter, pip falls back to compiling, and on python:3.12-slim — no
 * compiler, no headers — that is not a slow install but a dead deploy:
 * `psycopg2-binary` stops with `Error: pg_config executable not found` for a
 * Django project whose requirements.txt looks entirely ordinary.
 *
 * Installing every database client would double the image and installing only
 * Postgres breaks every MySQL app, so the manifest decides. Same shape as
 * {@see \App\Lib\Deploy\Platform\Runtime\Ruby\SystemPackages}, kept apart while
 * the lists are all that differ — the lists being what anyone comes here to
 * edit.
 *
 * No Laravel dependencies — unit-testable.
