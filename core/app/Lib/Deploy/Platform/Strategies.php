/**
 * The strategy ids the deploy pipeline knows how to build and run.
 *
 * A fair question is why any of these are in PHP at all, when every platform
 * declares its own `strategy` in YAML. The answer is that they fall into two
 * groups, and only one of them is irreducible.
 *
 * **Dispatched** — {@see DeployStrategy::apply()} branches on these by name,
 * because "use the PHP writer" is not something a manifest can say: PAEMD,
 * COMPOSE, DOCKERFILE, LARAVEL, PHP, RAILS, RUBY, RAILPACK, STATIC, FALLBACK.
 * Ten ids, and each one exists because a distinct piece of code runs for it.
 *
 * **Grouped** — everything else reaches the one framework writer generically
 * via {@see isGenerated()}. Their individual constants earn their
 * place only in tests, which read better asserting `Strategies::NEXTJS` than
 * `'nextjs'`. Nothing in `app/` switches on them one by one; what it needs is
 * the group membership in {@see JS_FRAMEWORKS} and {@see LANGUAGES}.
 *
 * The lists stay hand-maintained rather than derived from the manifests. A
 * derived list would make the contract test assert that the manifests agree
 * with themselves; this way, a platform whose strategy is genuinely new has
 * to be admitted here, which is the moment to notice that the generators do
 * not handle it yet.
