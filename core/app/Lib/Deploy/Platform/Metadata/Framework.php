/**
 * A framework the project depends on, at the version it depends on.
 *
 * Separate from {@see \App\Lib\Deploy\Platform\Runtime\Requirement}, which
 * answers "which PHP goes in the image". This answers "which Laravel is this",
 * and the two are unrelated: a project can pin PHP 8.3 and run Laravel 9 or
 * Laravel 12 on it, and only the second decides whether `php artisan optimize`
 * is a sensible thing to run.
 *
 * `version` is the resolved one when a lockfile could supply it and null when
 * only a range was declared, which is why `constraint` is kept alongside
 * rather than being overwritten by it. Reporting `^11.0` as though it were an
 * installed version would be a guess dressed as a fact.
 *
 * No Laravel dependencies — unit-testable.
