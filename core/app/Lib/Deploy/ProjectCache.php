/**
 * Everything the host caches on a project's behalf, under one directory per
 * project.
 *
 * The layout is `/var/cache/panelalpha/projects/<username>/<cache>`, and the
 * ordering is the whole point. It used to be cache-first -- the JS caches at
 * `/var/cache/panelalpha/js/<username>`, Composer's at
 * `/var/cache/pa-composer/<username>` -- which meant every question about a
 * project ("how much is it caching?", "delete it") had to enumerate the cache
 * types, and every new cache type had to be added to each of those places.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical: account teardown removed the JS cache and never
 * learned about Composer's, so deleting a PHP account leaked ~19MB
 * permanently. Project-first makes teardown one `rm -rf` of one directory,
 * which cannot miss a cache that did not exist when it was written, and makes
 * a Ruby or Python cache a matter of adding a name to {@see NAMES} rather
 * than touching cleanup at all.
 *
 * Only the *host* side moves. What these directories are mounted at inside a
 * build container is unchanged and deliberately so: `/var/cache/pa-composer`
 * is baked into the shared PHP base as `ENV COMPOSER_CACHE_DIR`, and that
 * image's tag carries a date somebody bumps rather than a hash of what went
 * into it -- so changing this constant alters the image's contents without
 * changing its name, and every host keeps serving the old one. Change it and
 * bump `recipe:` in `config/core/images.yaml` in the same edit.
 *
 * No Laravel dependencies -- unit-testable.
