/**
 * The schema an editor validates a check file against, and the parser that
 * reads it, have to be the same vocabulary.
 *
 * Nothing tied them together, and the drift was real rather than theoretical:
 * `expect` gained `path` and `json` in the parser and the schema was updated
 * beside it, but nothing would have failed if it had not been. Worse, the
 * shipped check files were never validated at all -- so a `$schema` reference
 * pointing at a file that does not exist, which is what a recipe's first check
 * shipped with, went unnoticed until it was read by eye.
 *
 * The same shape {@see \Tests\Unit\Deploy\Platform\SourceRecipeTest} already
 * uses for the manifest schemas: the lists are asserted equal, so adding a key
 * to one and forgetting the other is a failing test rather than a silent
 * divergence.
