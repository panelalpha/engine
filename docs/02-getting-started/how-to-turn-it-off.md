# How to turn telemetry off

Telemetry is on by default, so reports do leave your VPS unless you change something. What it is, why it is there, and what it gives you: [Telemetry](what-is-collected.md).

The usual switch is a `pae` command. It takes effect immediately. You do not restart the engine. The options further down are lines in `/opt/panelalpha/shared-hosting/.env-core`, and those do nothing until you restart: [Change a setting](install.md#change-a-setting).

## Stop sending anything

```bash
pae telemetry:disable
```

What this does: stops reports being sent, tells monitoring to stop checking this VPS by email, and refuses new bug reports. The **scheduled** six-hourly health sweep does not run.

What you should see: `Telemetry sending disabled.`

Check it worked:

```bash
pae telemetry:status
```

You want `Sending reports: no` and `Bug reports: no`.

To turn sending back on:

```bash
pae telemetry:enable
```

**What you give up:** the six-hourly sweep is what tells you a site broke *after* it deployed, and it stops running. Checking a site yourself still works: ask your assistant, or run `pae project:deploy:check` / `pae project:health:report --local`. Those on-demand checks are local; they are not telemetry.

## Keep the automatic reports, refuse bug reports

```bash
TELEMETRY_BUG_REPORTS=false
```

Then restart the engine. Automatic deploy and health reports carry on. Filing a bug report is refused.

The reasoning: automatic reports are measurements the engine took, with no free text and no contact details. A bug report contains a description somebody typed and possibly an email address. If you are comfortable with the first and not the second, this is the setting.

## Keep the checks, send nothing

```bash
PANELALPHA_MONITORING=
```

Leave the value empty, then restart the engine. Reports are still produced and recorded on your VPS, but there is nowhere to send them. The six-hourly health check still runs, so you keep the "this site broke since it deployed" alerts. Choose this if your objection is to data leaving your VPS rather than to the checks themselves.

## What turning it off does not do

**It does not delete anything already on your VPS.** The queue and the local log stay where they are.

**It does not affect the error messages you rely on.** The plain-sentence explanations in your deploy logs are produced locally and have nothing to do with telemetry: [Reading errors](reading-errors.md).

**It does not disable on-demand health checks.** The scheduled six-hourly sweep is telemetry, so it stops when sending is fully off. Checking a site yourself still works:

```bash
pae project:deploy:check <project>
pae project:health:report --local
```

`--local` records the result without sending it, which is how you get a verdict on a server with telemetry off.

## Troubleshooting

**`pae telemetry:status` still shows sending as on.**
Use `pae telemetry:disable`. Editing `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false` in `.env-core` is not enough after a normal install: the engine already recorded sending as on, and that recorded choice wins until you run the command.

**I set `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false` but the log file is still growing.**
Expected. Turning sending off stops reports being sent, not the local log being written.

**I want to report a bug but filing is refused.**
Filing needs telemetry on, because otherwise nothing would ever deliver the report. Run `pae telemetry:enable` for that one report, or contact PanelAlpha directly at [manage.panelalpha.com/contact](https://manage.panelalpha.com/contact).
