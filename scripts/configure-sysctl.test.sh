#
# The regression this guards: the file it used to write was
#
#     kernel.panic = 3
#     vm.panic_on_oom = 1
#
# and that pair rebooted hosts mid-deploy. `vm.panic_on_oom = 0` is the fix,
# and it has to stay *written* rather than omitted -- `sysctl --system` applies
# the values files name and never resets a setting a file stopped mentioning,
# so a host that already had 1 would keep it until its next reboot.
